## General Overview
I had two old gaming computers that I don't use anymore, and an old Raspberry Pi that was previously used as a retro gaming console, and figured they would be perfect to make a small homelab out of. They definitely don't have the most firepower, but they are definitely enough for some cool projects. The goal of this homelab is to familiarize myself with some tools, gain some experience in documenting that progress, and to have fun while creating something.
### Software
The two servers are running Proxmox Virtual Environment. I quite adore Proxmox and it suits the needs of a homelab. The Raspberry Pi is very limited on resources, however, that doesn't stop this 32 bit machine from running Raspberry Pi OS Lite, with the sole purpose of being a Cloudflare tunnel.
